## Movie Recommendation System
This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system using TF-IDF vectorization and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to suggest movies based on user input. The system processes movie descriptions, genres, and languages to find the best matches.

# Setup

pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn

# Download NLTK resources:
2. Run the following inside a Python script or Jupyter Notebook:
`import nltk`
`nltk.download('punkt')`
`nltk.download('stopwords')`
`nltk.download('wordnet')`

# Dataset
3. Download the dataset and and place it in the project direcotry.
